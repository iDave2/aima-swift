Contributing to this project
==========================
:+1::tada: I have not thought ahead that far but sure, by all means, welcome. :tada::+1:

This aima-variant may not follow the book as closely as others.  Significant effort and
commentary aims at learning Swift, at least at the beginning, but aima is the longer-term 
goal.

Documentation and modeling borrow from [aima-python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) 
and [aima-java](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java) (thanks, guys).

Assorted notes are [on the wiki](https://github.com/iDave2/aima-swift/wiki).

## Issues
- Prefix all global names with `AIma` so that `AImaKit` does not conflict with other frameworks
like `UIKit`?
- Minimize global symbols?
- Add GUI's, perhaps separate projects that reference AImaKit.
- Learn how to distribute a properly signed AImaKit binary for users who prefer to focus on AIMA rather
than Swift.
- And so on...
